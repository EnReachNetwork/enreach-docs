### How to Earn BERRY Rewards

BERRY can be earned from providing network resources with your Chrome Extension Nodes and from the Referral Programs. You will enjoy an extra boost on your BERRY rewards according to your user level. 

* **Network Rewards**
	* Keep your Chrome Extension Node online (your Chrome running, with internet access) and your Network Rewards will automatically accumulate. 
	* Your rewards in BERRY will be updated about every one hour.
	* You can check your rewards earned by each of your node respectively in the dashboard. 
	* Four key factors are considered in the assessment: IP Quality, Uptime, Network Delay, and Package Lost. 
	* When multiple nodes share one IP, they will split the rewards correspondingly, as IP sharing significantly reduces network quality for each single node. 
* **Referral Program** 
	* You can refer your friends by: 1) giving referral code; 2) sharing registration link (which contains the referral code); 3) sharing a tweet that contains the referral link. 
	* You will share a commission from the network rewards of your referee: 1) for direct referral - 15%; 2) for indirect referral (referee of your referee) - 5%; 
	* The commission calculation is based on your refereeâ€™s Network Rewards (to avoid iteration/overlapping)
	* Immediate BERRY Bonus on successful referrals: when your referee has been online for 72 hours, you and your referee will both get a fixed amount of BERRY bonus.	 
* **An Example**
	* Suppose: You have earned 300 BERRY from Network Rewards, and 120 BERRY from Referral Program; Your user level is Teen Berry (which gives you +50% extra boost). Your final BERRY rewards will be (300+120) * 150% = 630 BERRY

### FAQ

**Q: Is VPN allowed for running a Chrome Extension Node?**

A: VPN is not restricted. However, using VPN usually comes with inferior network quality. 

**Q: Can I manage multiple nodes under one user account in the dashboard?**

A: Yes. Technically you are allowed to run as mamy nodes as you want under one user account and this reduces complexity for collecting rewards. However, managing nodes that exceeds normal range is not encouraged and may be identified as sybil attacks. In BERRY Season 1, only your top 5 nodes (according to the score earned during last hour) will be added up to your user account. 

**Q: Will my Chrome Extension Nodes occupy my network resources (such as internet bandwidth, CPU, RAM, etc.)?**

A: No. The Chrome Extension Node is super light, which means it does not interupt your daily use of your internet or your device. The Chrome Extension Node offers an easy onboarding for entry-level resource providers and those who are interested in providing more resources to EnReach's edge cloud on mainnet.
