### Plug It
In the Berry Testnet, you can test out how the Edge Node works in the EnReach Edge Cloud. 

Hardware or Software, your choice:

1. **Berry Box** is the dedicated plug-and-play device that can run in your home. It is specially optimized for high uptime and rewards efficiency. 
2. **Berry Router** is the WiFi router with built-in EnReach client. Get the router and earn while you browse!
3. **Software Node** has the EnReach Software Image intalled on your own device: PC, Workstation, or even a data center. It is the choice if you are a real Pro User.  

### Install It
Installing the Edge Node means you are connecting your device to the EnReach Network (the Edge Cloud). You need several step to get the setup and configuration ready. 

Steps to follow:

1. Get your EnReach Account on the [EnReach Dashboard](https://dashboard.enreach.network). The registration is super easy and don't forget to input the Referral Code for extra benefits. 
2. If you run the Hardware Node, please follow the <Link to="/user-guides/device-setup">Device Setup</Link> guide. If you run the Software Node, please follow the <Link to="/user-guides/software-setup">Software Setup</Link> guide.

### Start Earning
Great! Now you are ready to earn rewards in the EnReach Testnet!
