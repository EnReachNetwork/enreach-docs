# Referral Program

### Referral Code
Every EnReach Account has a six-digit Referral Code. You can find your Referral Code in the Dashboard->Referral page. 

When you want to refer a friend to join EnReach, either way will just work fine for you and your friend:

1. Send the Referral Code to your friend and ask your friend to input this code in new account registration in the dashboard. 
2. Send the Invitation Link (which contains the Referral Code inside) directly to your friend and let your friend proceed to the new account registration from this Invitation Link. 

### Referral Commission 

The benefit for the Referrer (the person who refer his or her friend to join EnReach) is the **Commission**. 

Normally, the Referrer will get a **15%** Commission from the mining rewards of the friend referred. This Commission works for the first-tier referrals and will last during the whole Testnet Campaign period. 

A special Referral Program may apply for those who want to contribute more to expand the EnReach Community. In this case, the Referrer enjoys **15%** First-tier Commission plus **2%** second-tier Commission. Please contact EnReach Team for the special Referral Program.

### Referee Benefits

For all Edge Node runners, providing a Referral Code on EnReach Account registration will give the Referee (the person who is referred to EnReach) an extra boost on mining -- there will be a **20%** boost on mining rewards for the first 14 days from the first day that generates rewards.

For users who purchase Hardware Node Devices (Berry Box or Berry Routers), providing a Referral Code on the e-commerce page will bring you a **cash discount**. Please refer to the policy of hardware resellers for more details.
