Welcome to the Berry Devnet! Click to see a [**quick video guide**](https://youtu.be/YtjHVk2KA9w)!


### 1. Plug It
In the Devnet, you can test out how the Edge Node works in the Aro Edge Cloud. 

Hardware or Software, your choice:

1. **Berry Box** is the dedicated plug-and-play device that can run in your home. It is specially optimized for high uptime and rewards efficiency. 
2. **Berry Router** is the WiFi router with built-in Aro client. Get the router and earn while you browse!
3. **Software Node (coming soon)** has the Aro Software Image intalled on your own device: PC, Workstation, or even a data center. It is the choice if you are a real Pro User.  

### 2. Install It
Installing the Edge Node means you are connecting your device to the Aro Network (the Edge Cloud). You need several step to get the setup and configuration ready. 

Steps to follow:

1. Get your Aro Account on the [Aro Devnet Dashboard](https://devnet.dashboard.Aro.network). The registration is super easy and don't forget to input the Referral Code for extra benefits. 
2. You can choose to run **Berry Box** or **Berry Router** as the hardware nodes. Software nodes will follow later. 

### 3. Start Your Aro Journey
Great! Now you are ready to start your Aro journey as an Edge Node runner!

What you can get from Devnet:

1. The Devnet is not Testnet. The Devnet will not be fully open to community for large-scale open testing. Join Devnet early helps you to get familiar with how Aro works and get ready for the later stages such as Testnet and Mainnet. 
2. Your feedback is important and helps us to improve particularly at this early stage. 
3. Remember, you will not be earning real mining rewards on Devnet, but your participation and effort will be acknowledged and you will get certain rewards when Devnet is ended.
