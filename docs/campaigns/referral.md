# Referral Program

### About Referral Program

The **Referral Program** works as a long term mechanism for growing Aro's community and user base. 

This is the program for everyone and benefits everyone. You will enjoy extra benefits by referring your friends to join Aro Network, or being referred. 

### What's for the Referrer

The **Referrer** (the person who refers/invites another person to join Aro Network) enjoys extra **Referral Bonus** rewards which are added into the total rewards.  

The **Referral Bonus** is calculated based on the total Edge Node Rewards earned by the referees. This bonus works basically like a commission -- the Referrer get a fixed % (currently set to `15%`) based on the Referees' rewards.  

> Note: the Commission Rate % can be adjusted when there is a policy change. Please find the up-to-date policy in the 'Referral' area on your Dashboard. 

Normally the commission is calculated based on the Edge Node Rewards earned by the **first-tier** referees. This mean only the person who is **directly referred** by you will contribute to your Referral Bonus. However, we apply special policies which allow certain users (i.e. KoLs, big distributor, pioneers in new business regions, etc.) to earn an extra **second-tier** commission as Referral Bonus. This extra benefits are not granted for certain -- you need to contact the team and prove to us that you have the capabilities to make special contributions to Aro's community growth.  

### What's for the Referee

The **Referee** (the person who is referred/invited to join Aro Network by the Referrer) enjoys extra **boost on the Edge Node Rewards**. 

This boost will give you an extra % when calculating your Edge Node Rewards (the rewards you earn from running Edge Nodes in Aro Network). 

Currently, you will get `20%` extra boost for the first `14 days` on a successful referral. 

> Note: the parameters of the boost can be adjusted when there is a policy change. Please find the up-to-date policy in the 'Stats' area on your Dashboard. 

The boost will apply right after you have filled in the Referral Code on initial account setup. That said, it is allowed to fill in the Referral Code **anytime later**, and the boost will follow.
