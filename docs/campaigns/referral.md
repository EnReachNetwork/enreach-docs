# Referral Program

### About the Referral Program

The **Referral Program** is a long-term initiative designed to grow the ARO community and user base.

This program benefits everyone. Both referrers and referees enjoy additional rewards by inviting friends to join the ARO Network or by being referred.

### Benefits for the Referrer

The **Referrer** (the person who invites others to join the ARO Network) earns an additional **Referral Bonus** added to their total rewards.

The **Referral Bonus** is calculated as a percentage of the Edge Node Rewards earned by referees. Currently, referrers receive a **15% commission** based on their refereesâ€™ rewards.

> **Note**: The commission rate may change with policy updates. Check the latest policy in the **Referral** section of your Dashboard.

The bonus typically applies to **first-tier referees** (those directly referred by you). However, special policies may allow certain users (e.g., KOLs, major distributors, or pioneers in new regions) to earn an additional **second-tier commission**. These extra benefits are not guaranteed and require contacting the ARO team to demonstrate your ability to significantly contribute to community growth.

### Benefits for the Referee

The **Referee** (the person invited to join the ARO Network) receives an **Edge Node Rewards boost**.

This boost increases your Edge Node Rewards (earned from running Edge Nodes) by an additional percentage. Currently, referees enjoy a **20% boost** for the first **14 days** after a successful referral.

> **Note**: The boost parameters may change with policy updates. Check the latest policy in the **Stats** section of your Dashboard.

The boost applies immediately after entering a Referral Code during initial account setup. You can also enter a Referral Code later, and the boost will be applied accordingly.
