# Frequently Asked Questions About Edge Nodes

**Q: Which is better, Hardware Nodes or Software Nodes?**

A: All Edge Nodes are equally capable. Hardware Nodes (**ARO Pod** and **ARO Link**) offer a higher level of integration, making them easier to install, configure, and maintain compared to Software Nodes (**ARO Client**).

**Q: Can I run an Edge Node anywhere in the world?**

A: Technically, you can run an Edge Node anywhere. However, Edge Nodes perform best when located near end users, as this is fundamental to how the Edge Cloud operates. For optimal results, we recommend running an Edge Node in a region with existing ARO services to maximize revenue potential.

**Q: Does the device compromise user privacy?**

A: No. ARO never collects personal data from your daily operations. The only resource ARO utilizes is your idle bandwidthâ€”nothing more.

**Q: Does joining the ARO network affect my internet usage?**

A: No. ARO only uses your idle bandwidth, ensuring no disruption to your regular internet activities. You can earn passive income while using the internet as usual.

ARO Hardware Nodes (**ARO Pod** and **ARO Link**) are dedicated, highly integrated devices designed to optimize resource contribution without impacting your daily internet experience.
