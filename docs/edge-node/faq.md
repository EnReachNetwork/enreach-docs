**Q: Hardware Node or Software Node, which one is better/stronger/superior?**

A: All Edge Nodes are equal. Hardware Nodes have higher level of integration so they will be easier to install, configure and maintain compared with the Software Nodes.  

**Q: Can I run an Edge Node anywhere in the world?**

A: This is a good question. Technically you can run an Edge Node anywhere in this world. But remember: you need to be physically close to the end users -- this is how the Edge Cloud works. Practically, we suggest you to run an Edge Node in the region that has existing EnReach services so that you can benefit from the real revenue generated in that area.
