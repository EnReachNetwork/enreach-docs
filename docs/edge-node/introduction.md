# Introduction

The core philosophy of Edge Cloud is simple: place servers closer to users. By doing so, users experience faster response times and significantly reduced network costs. This means that wherever users are located, we must recruit nodes that can serve them nearby—otherwise, the very essence of Edge Cloud breaks down.

We refer to these smaller nodes as **Edge Nodes**. Technically, anyone can run an Edge Node. **Even household devices and network resources can be used, with minimal impact on daily life.** This aligns perfectly with the spirit of DePIN—contributing idle or surplus resources in exchange for fair rewards.

That said, Edge Nodes don’t necessarily have to be highly miniaturized. In fact, the ARO Network is designed as a set of protocols that enables **heterogeneous resources** to interact and deliver effective network services to users.
