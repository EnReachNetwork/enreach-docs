# Introduction

The core philosophy of Edge Cloud is simple: place servers closer to users. By doing so, users experience faster response times, and network costs are significantly reduced. This means wherever users are, we must recruit nodes that serve users nearby—otherwise, the very essence of Edge Cloud breaks down.

We refer to these smaller nodes as **Edge Nodes**. Technically, anyone can become an Edge Node. **You could even use household devices and network resources with minimal impact on your daily life.** This aligns perfectly with the spirit of DePIN—contributing your idle or surplus resources and earning reasonable rewards in return.

That said, Edge Nodes don’t necessarily have to be highly miniaturized. In fact, the EnReach Network is designed as a set of protocols that enable **heterogeneous resources** to interact and deliver effective network resources to user.
