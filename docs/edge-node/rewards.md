# Rewards

Aro incentivizes resource providers, known as **Edge Nodes**, to contribute internet resources such as storage, compute, and bandwidth, by rewarding them with native tokens. 

Rewards are based on verified contributions using mechanisms like workload validation and randomized challenges, ensuring fairness and trust.

Participation is **permissionless**â€”any hardware can join the network and turn idle resources into revenue. To support early growth, Aro subsidizes contributions until application revenue sustains the ecosystem, creating a self-reinforcing loop of growth and incentives.
