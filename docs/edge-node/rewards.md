# Rewards

ARO incentivizes resource providers, known as **Edge Nodes**, to contribute internet resources—such as storage, compute, and bandwidth—by rewarding them with native tokens.

These rewards are distributed based on verified contributions, using mechanisms like workload validation and randomized challenges to ensure fairness and trust.

**Participation is permissionless**—any hardware can join the network and convert idle resources into revenue. To support early-stage growth, ARO subsidizes contributions until application-level revenue can sustain the ecosystem, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and incentives.
