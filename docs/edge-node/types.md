# Types

Now that you have a basic understanding of how Edge Nodes work, you might be wondering: what type of Edge Node is best for you?

### Hardware Nodes

ARO is owned by the crowd, not the cloud. And the good news is—you don’t need to be tech-savvy to participate. You can easily run an Edge Node right from your home.

Simply install the device, register an account through the [dashboard](https://devnet-dashboard.aro.network), and start earning rewards by contributing your idle internet resources. It’s that simple.

Currently, two specific hardware models support ARO clients: the **ARO Pod** and the **ARO Link**.

### Software Nodes

ARO is a permissionless Edge Cloud network designed to utilize heterogeneous resources. To support this, ARO offers a **software image** (the **ARO Client**) that can be run on a wide range of devices—PCs, workstations, or even data centers.

Keep in mind that the software image is intended more for **Pro Users**. Running it requires higher technical capabilities from both the device and the user.
