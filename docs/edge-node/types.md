Now you might have some basic idea of how Edge Node works, but what kind of Edge Nodes best work for you?  

### Hardware Nodes

EnReach is owned by the crowd, not the cloud. Rest assured: we guarantee that, even if you have no idea at all of the tech-savvy concepts, you will be able to run an Edge Node, just at your home. 

Install the device, register an account in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.enreach.network), and you will be starting to earn from your contributed idle internet resources. That's so easy. 

Currently two specific models of hardware are supported to run EnReach client: the **Berry Box** and the **Berry Router**.  

### Software Nodes

EnReach is a permissionless Edge Cloud network. That is, EnReach makes use of heterogeneous resources. EnReach provides a **software image** that you can run on all kinds of devices you have: PC, Workstation, or even Data Center. 

Bear in mind that the software image is more like "the solution for **Pro Users**". Running the software image requires higher capabilities both for the device and the owner.
