# Edge Node Types

Wondering which Edge Node is best for you? Here’s an overview of the available options to help you decide.

### Hardware Nodes (ARO Pod & ARO Link)

The ARO Network is community-driven, not cloud-controlled. Best of all, you don’t need to be tech-savvy to participate—you can run an Edge Node right from your home.

Hardware Nodes are ideal for **beginners**, offering pre-configured, user-friendly devices optimized for efficient operation. They simplify setup by eliminating the need to configure Node Clients or adapt to your internet environment.

Two Hardware Node models are currently available: **ARO Pod** and **ARO Link**.

- The **ARO Pod** is a compact, plug-and-play device designed for 24/7 operation with exceptional uptime, perfect for home use.
- The **ARO Link** doubles as a standard router while generating revenue from your idle internet resources, making it ideal for business scenarios with dual functionality.

### Software Nodes (ARO Client)

The ARO Network is a permissionless Edge Cloud designed to leverage diverse resources. To support this, ARO provides a **software image** (the **ARO Client**) that can be installed on various devices, including PCs, workstations, or data centers.

Note that the **ARO Client** is geared toward **advanced users**, requiring greater technical expertise from both the device and the operator.

### Lite Nodes (ARO Lite)

For those seeking an accessible entry point, **ARO Lite** nodes operate as lightweight **browser extensions**, such as a **Chrome extension**. These nodes enable anyone to join the ARO Network with minimal cost and effort.

By deploying **ARO Lite**, ARO facilitates exploratory resource building in new markets, establishing the supply needed for robust Edge Cloud services. This makes **ARO Lite** an ideal way to expand the network’s user base.

While **ARO Lite** nodes generate rewards like other Edge Nodes, their lower service capacity results in smaller rewards compared to Hardware or Software Nodes.
