# The New Edge

### Edge Cloud Is a Closer Cloud

The concept behind Edge Cloud is quite straightforward: **bring cloud servers (physically) closer to users.**

Computer science is bound by the laws of physics. Simply running a program closer to where a request originates—**at the network’s edge**—is enough to provide faster responses for end users. (And yes, that’s where Edge Cloud gets its name.)

### You Are Using Edge Cloud, Everyday

Edge Cloud is an integral component of modern digital infrastructure, seamlessly supporting services used by billions of people every day.

For instance, in the case of YouTube, video content is not always served directly from centralized data centers. Instead, YouTube strategically caches high-demand videos on regional edge servers located closer to end users. Edge Cloud is the hero in today's super-rich-content internet.
