# Open-layered Fabric

EnReach introduces a paradigm shift by creating a **permissionless, distributed edge cloud** through its **open-layered fabric**. &#x20;

In abstract terms, EnReach functions as an open-layered fabric that connects and coordinates the underlying Resource Layer and the Application Layer above. Its core role is to organize distributed edge resources and align them with demand from applications. At the same time, EnReach provides a hosting platform for edge applications, enabling them to access resilient edge resources at minimal cost.

### The Open Protocol

For globally distributed edge resources, EnReach acts as an **Open Protocol**.

The first prerequisite for constructing an open edge cloud ecosystem is organizing a large-scale, globally distributed network of nodes. These nodes are spread across various regions, managed by EnReach’s scheduling capabilities, and provide robust and resilient storage and transmission capabilities. This network forms the decentralized foundation of the edge cloud.

The specific functions and roles of the EnReach Open Protocol include:

* Aggregating resources worldwide, including network, storage, and compute capabilities, ensuring these resources join and remain active in the EnReach network through a permissionless model.
* Structuring and connecting these resources into a cohesive abstraction, enabled by EnReach’s advanced virtualization and standardization technology.
* Quantitatively evaluating resource workloads with fair metrics to prevent manipulation and cheating.
* Offering well-designed economic incentives to ensure stable service delivery from nodes while providing rewards. EnReach provides substantial returns on edge resources that would otherwise sit idle.

### The Open Platform

For applications that demand edge resources, EnReach serves as an **Open Platform**.

Many applications have specific demands for edge-side resources, requiring a platform specifically designed and optimized for the edge to support and host them. For example, generative AI inference needs to be as close to the user as possible to improve response times and conserve core network resources.

EnReach provides an open platform tailored for these types of applications.

* The Open Platform is a guiding concept realized as an actual platform—a PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering, open to all applications.
* This platform is scalable, resilient, and equipped with compute capabilities, ultimately delivering a comprehensive PaaS solution.
* In the initial stages, EnReach’s economic model will subsidize resources within the network, as applications may not yet generate sufficient revenue.
* This subsidy period will not be prolonged. EnReach will soon establish a self-sustaining cycle, enabling the resource layer to receive funding from the application layer.
