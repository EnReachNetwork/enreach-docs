In abstract terms, EnReach functions as an Open-layered fabric that connects and coordinates the underlying Resource Layer and the Application Layer above. Its core role is to organize distributed edge resources and align them with demand from applications (users). At the same time, EnReach provides a hosting platform for edge applications, enabling them to access resilient edge resources at minimal cost.
