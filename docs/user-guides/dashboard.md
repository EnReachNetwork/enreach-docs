# Dashboard

### General Guide

The [Dashboard](https://devnet-dashboard.ARO.network/) is your all-in-one platform for managing Edge Nodes and rewards.

With the Dashboard, you can:
- Create an ARO Account
- Access your Referral Code, invite friends to join ARO, and earn Referral Rewards
- Manage all your Edge Nodes
- Track and manage your rewards
- Manage your funds

### ARO Account

New users must register an **ARO Account** to get started. Once registered, you can sign in anytime, anywhere to manage your Edge Nodes and related activities.

This is the **Sign In** page. If you're new to ARO, click **Sign Up** at the bottom to create your ARO Account. You can register using an email address or a Google Account. For email registration, you’ll need to set a password and verify your email.

![Input Referral Code](/img/user-guides/input_referral_code.png)

During registration, you’ll be prompted to enter a **Referral Code**. Using a Referral Code grants a 20% reward boost for a limited period after signing up. If you don’t have a code, you can skip this step and add one later.

### What’s in the Dashboard?

The **topbar** provides access to all available pages:

- **Edge Node**: View and manage all Edge Nodes linked to your ARO Account. You can add new nodes or remove existing ones. Clicking a device card displays detailed information about that node.

  > To learn how to add a new Edge Node to the Dashboard, refer to <Link to="/user-guides/device-setup">this guide</Link>.

- **Stats**: Monitor the number of Edge Nodes you’re running, their online status, and the total rewards earned from operating them.
- **Funds**: Manage your funds, including claiming token rewards to your wallet.

  > **Wallet binding** and **token claiming** features will be available at a later stage.

- **Referral**: Access your Referral Code, copy Referral Links, and track bonuses earned through referrals.
- **ARO ID**: Manage basic account settings and operations for your ARO Account.
