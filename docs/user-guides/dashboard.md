# Dashboard

### General Guide

The [Dashboard](https://devnet.dashboard.Aro.network/) is an all-in-one entry for users to manage their Edge Nodes and rewards. 

In the Dashboard, you will be able to: 

- Create an Aro Account
- Find your Referral Code, refer your friends to join Aro, and get Referral Rewards
- Manage all your Edge Nodes
- Manage your rewards 
- Manage your funds

### Aro Account 

For the first time user, you need to register an **Aro Account** (sign up for Aro). After successful registration, you will be able to sign in to your Aro Account anytime and anywhere to manage your Edge Nodes and everything else. 

![Sign in Page](/img/user-guides/sign_in_page.png)

This is the **Sign In** Page. If you are new to Aro, click on the **'Sign Up'** in the bottom area to register your new Aro Account. Either email or Google Account is accepted. For email registration, you need to set up the password and have your email verified. 

![Input Referral Code](/img/user-guides/input_referral_code.png)

You will be asked to input a **Referral Code** in the next step. The Referral Code will give you extra boost of 20% for a certain period after your registration. If you don't have a Referral Code, you can just **skip** at this stage and input your Referral Code later. 

### What's In The Dashboard?

You will find a **topbar** that shows all the tabs to the pages that you have access to:

- **Edge Node**: This page displays all the Edge Nodes under your Aro Account's control. You can add new Edge Nodes or delete existing ones from this page. Click on the device card and you will get into a page for more detailed information about this device. 

> If you want to learn detailed steps to add your new device (Edge Node) to the dashboard, please refer to <Link to="/user-guides/device-setup">**this guide**</Link>.

- **Stats**: This page gives you an overall view of how many Edge Nodes you are running (and how many of them are online), and how much rewards you have gained from running these Edge Nodes. 
- **Funds**: This page the place that you can manage your funds, such as claiming token rewards with your wallets. 

> **Wallet binding** and **token claim** will be available on later stage. 

- **Referral**: This is where you can manage everything about your Referrals. You can find your Referral Code, copy Referral Links, and learn how much bonus you have earned from the Referral. 
- **Aro ID**: This is where you can manage basic operations on your Aro Account.
