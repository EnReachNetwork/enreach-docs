### Get Started With Your New Device!

You may need this guide if you:

- Want to know how to add your new device to your Dashboard;

If you want to learn more about Hardware Nodes, please refer to <Link to="/edge-node/types">**this introduction**</Link>.

If you want to know what type of Edge Node is best for you, please refer to  <Link to="/user-guides/run-node">**this guide**</Link>. 

Here is a [**quick video guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtjHVk2KA9w) to help you get onboard easily. 


### Step 1: Plug In

It is extremely easy and intuitive to "plug-and-play" the Hardware Nodes, i.e. the **Berry Box** and the **Berry Router**.  

Just **unbox**, **power on**, and **connect to the internet with the cable**. It will be done in one minute. Make sure you have internet connection and you can proceed to Step 2. 


### Step 2: Add Device To Your Dashboard

Make sure you have already created you EnReach Account (EnReach ID) and log in to your Dashboard. 

> Refer to <Link to="/user-guides/dashboard">**this guide**</Link> for account creation process.

In the **Edge Node** page of your Dashboard, you will find **"Add Your Edge Node"** button (or the small buttom which is always on the top right area). 

Click on the button and select Node Type (Hardware Node for our case) to initiate the add process. 

> Notice: The new device **MUST** be online (powered on and have internet connection) during the Add process. 

![Dashboard SN](/img/user-guides/dashboard_SN.png)

In this page you will be asked to manually input the **SN (Serial Number)** of your device. You can find the SN on the device label. Be careful, don't make typos!

If everything goes well, the Dashboard will recognize your device, and then you will finish the Add process in a few clicks. 


### Step 3: Ready To Go!

When the device is successfully added to your Dashboard, you will see the **device card** appeared on the **Edge Node** page. Now you are ready to go with your first EnReach Edge Node!
