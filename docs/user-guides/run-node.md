# Running an Edge Node - General Guide

### Things to Know Before You Start
Here are key points to understand before running an Edge Node on the ARO Network:

1. ARO is a **permissionless** network, meaning no prior permission or qualification is required to join.
2. A stable internet connection is essential. Higher bandwidth and connection stability significantly increase your rewards from running an Edge Node.
3. The **region** where you run your Edge Node matters. Being closer to end users enhances their access to internet content, resulting in higher rewards.
4. You can exit the network and claim your rewards at any time.
5. Edge Nodes primarily utilize your **idle internet resources** to serve the ARO Edge Network, with minimal impact on your regular internet experience. The choice is always yours.
6. You can run either a **Hardware Node** or a **Software Node** (software solutions will be available soon). Refer to the next section for guidance on choosing the best option.

### Which Type of Edge Node Is Right for Me?

The ARO Edge Node Client can theoretically run on a wide range of devices, from the plug-and-play ARO Pod to professional data centers.

Edge Nodes are divided into two main types: **Hardware Nodes** and **Software Nodes**.

**Hardware Nodes** are **ideal for beginners**, as they are pre-configured and optimized for user-friendly, efficient operation. They eliminate the complexity of setting up Node Clients and adapting them to your internet environment.

ARO currently supports two Hardware Node models: **ARO Pod** and **ARO Link**.

1. The **ARO Pod** is a compact, plug-and-play home device designed for 24/7 operation with exceptional uptime. It’s perfect for home use. See <Link to="/edge-node/device-specs">Hardware Specifications</Link> for more details.
2. The **ARO Link** functions as a standard router while earning revenue from your idle internet resources. It’s ideal for business scenarios, offering dual functionality. See <Link to="/edge-node/device-specs">Hardware Specifications</Link> for more details.

For **advanced users**, you can choose between Hardware Nodes or deploying the **ARO Client** software on your preferred devices. Guides will be available soon, following the release of the Edge Node software images.

### How Do I Manage My Edge Nodes?

The [Dashboard](https://devnet-dashboard.ARO.network/?mode=devnet&tab=nodes) (currently for Devnet) is your all-in-one platform for managing Edge Nodes and tracking rewards.

By creating an **ARO Account**, you can log in anytime, anywhere to manage your Edge Nodes and rewards.
