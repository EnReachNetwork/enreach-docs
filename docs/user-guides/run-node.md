# Run an Edge Node - the General Guide

### Things To Know Before You Start 
Here are the important things you need to know before you start running an Edge Node in EnReach Network. 

1. EnReach is a **permissionless** network, which means you do not need to get any permission or qualification before you are able to join the network. 
2. Internet connection is necessary. Better internet resources and internet quality (particularly concerning **bandwidth and connection stability**) really helps to increase your rewards from running the Edge Node. 
3. The **region** where you run the Edge Node matters as well as your internet resources and quality. The closer you are to the end users, the more you can help them access to internet contents (and the more reward accordingly). 
4. You can quit the network anytime as you want and take the rewards. 
5. Most of the time, the Edge Node that you are running utilizes your **idle and unused internet resources** to serve the EnReach Edge Network. Running an Edge Node will not hinder your user experiences in surfing the internet that much. It's always your choice.    
6. You can either run a **Hardware Node** or a **Software Node** (Software solutions will be delivered soon). You can refer to the following chapter if you have question in how to choose the best option for you. 

### What Type Of Edge Node Is Better For Me?

The EnReach Edge Node Client can theoretically be operated on a huge variaty of devices, from the plug-and-play Berry Boxes to the professional data centers. 

Generally, we classify Edge Nodes into two major types: **Hardware Nodes** and **Software Nodes**. 

**Hardware Nodes** is **the best choice for starters** because the devices are specially customized and optimized for running the Edge Node Clients to user-friendly, highly-efficient operating environment for the Edge Nodes. No need to bother with the mess and complexity of configurating the Node Clients and match them with your internet environment. 

Currently there are two models of Hardware Nodes supported by EnReach: **Berry Box** and **Berry Router**. 

1. The **Berry Box** is a small, home-run, plug-and-play box that can run 24/7 for extreme uptime performance. You can refer to <Link to="/edge-node/device-specs">Hardware Specs</Link> to learn more details about the specifications. 
2. The **Berry Router** works just like a normal router, but keeps earning you real money from utilizing your idle internet resources. One device, two benefits! You can refer to <Link to="/edge-node/device-specs">Hardware Specs</Link> to learn more details about the specifications. 

For **pro users**, you can have a wide range to choose between running the Hardware Nodes and implementing the software image on your preferred devices. Gudies will be availble soon, following the release of the Edge Node software images. 

### How Do I Manage My Edge Nodes?

The [Dashboard](https://devnet.dashboard.enreach.network/?mode=devnet&tab=nodes) (currently for the Devnet) is the all-in-one entry for you to manage your Edge Nodes as well as manage your rewards. 

Just create an **EnReach Account** and you will be able to log in to this account and manage all the Edge Node stuff anytime, anywhere.
